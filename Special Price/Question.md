## Problem Statement
You are given N size list of prices of deo where the ith price denotes the price of ith deo. You are assigned with a task of calculating the sum of prices.
You have been given Q queries. In each query you will be given two integers P1 and P2.
For each query you  have to find the sum of all prices of deos, which lies between P1 to P2 ( P1 and P2 inclusive).

## Constraints

1 <= A[i] <= (10^11)
1 <= Q <= (10^5)
1 <= P1,P2 <= (10^5)


## Input Format
The first line contains an integer N denoting the number of deos.
The second line contains N non ngetaive integers denoting the price of deo.
The third line contains Q denoting the number of queries.
Next Q lines contain P1 and P2 for each ith query.

## Output Format
For each query print the total price as per the statement stated in the question in the new line.
