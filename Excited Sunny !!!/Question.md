## Problem Statement
SUNNY is very excited today. Because he is going to get a number of a girl. But there is a twist, she put a condition that if he solves the problem then he is getting her number otherwise not.
She gives him T test Cases. Each test case contains a range [l,r] ( l and r inclusive ). Let Xi represent the number of divisors of the number i where l<=i<=r . Let Z represents the XOR of numbers X1,X2,X3,X4,....Xr . Sunny has to tell whether Z is Odd or Even.

## Constraints
1 <= T <= (10^5)
1 <= l,r <= (10^18)

## Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consist of two space separated integers l and r denoting the range [l,r].

## Output Format
For each test case, print "Odd"(without quotes) if value of Z is Odd or "Even" (without quotes) if value of Z is Even.
Answer for each test case should come in a new line.

## Test Cases
1
3 5

## Output to test cases
Odd

## Explanation
Divisors of 3 are 1,3 therefore X3 = 2
Similarly X4 = 3 and X5 = 2
Xor of (2,3,2) is 3 which is Odd.
