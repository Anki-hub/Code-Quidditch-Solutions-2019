## Problem Statement
A Cleanliness campaign was started by the Government called "Swachh Bharat Abhiyan" in 2014. This year an additional phase got added to the campaign known as "Plastic Mukt Swachh Bharat Abhiyan". In this campaign, we collect the plastic as much as possible in a group.

A group of people is collecting plastics. In a group there are N persons, 1st collect 2 plastics, 2nd collects 8, 3rd collects 24, 4th collects 64 and so on... You have to print the sum of all collected plastics by N persons. Since the sum could be very large, compute it modulo (10^9)+7.

## Constraints
1 <= N <= (10^5)

## Input Format
The input contains a single integer N denoting the number of people.

## Output Format
print a single line containing one integer â€• the sum of the plastics collected by N people under modulo (10^9)+7.

## Test Cases
5

## Output to test cases
258

## Explanation
you are given 5 people to collect plastics. 1st person collects 2 plastics, 2nd person collects 8 plastics, 3rd person collects 24 plastics, 4th person collects 64 plastics and 5th person collects 160 plastics. so total plastics collected by a group of 5 people is 258.
